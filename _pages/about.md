I am an assistant professor in the Stan Ross Department of Accountancy at Baruch College.

I hold a Ph.D. in accounting from Cornell University. In my research, I use archival methods to examine issues related to financial reporting. Broadly speaking, I am interested in how financial information is produced and utilized in capital markets. More specifically, my current research interests lie in emerging technologies, the real effects of accounting, and the changing dynamics between public and private firms. Another strand of my research explores how individual characteristics and behaviors shape the information environment.

Before embarking on my academic journey, I worked as an auditor at Deloitte in Toronto, Canada.
