I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Accounting in Johnson Graduate School of Management at [Cornell University](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Sanjeev Bhojraj](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/sb235/) (Chair), Prof. [Luo Zuo](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/lz352/) and Prof. [Travis Dyer](https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=8659).

My research interests focus on managing uncertainty in supply chains and understanding its implications for operational, financial and environmental performance. My current work explores data-driven decision making in multi-agent environments, with a particular focus on the impact of algorithmic competition on supply chain performance in the presence of vertical competition.

I am on the 2023-2024 academic job market.

See [here](/Research) for more about my research.
