I am an assistant professor at the Stan Ross Department of Accountancy, Baruch College. 

I hold a Ph.D. in accounting from the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. In my research, I use archival methods to examine issues related to financial reporting. Broadly speaking, I am interested in how financial information is produced and utilized in the capital markets. More specifically, my current research interest lies in emerging technologies, real effects of accounting, and the changing public-private firm dynamics. My other strand of research studies how individual characteristics and behavior shape the information environment. 

See [here](/Research/) for more about my research.
